## Tasks Included

1. **Microbiology**: Growth curve analysis and time to carrying capacity calculations.
2. **Botany and Plant Science**: Metabolic response analysis of wild-type vs mutants.
3. **Biochemistry & Oncology**: Investigating protein mutations and their structural/functional impacts.
4. **Transcriptomics**: Analyzing RNA-seq data and generating a volcano plot.
5. **Public Health**: Cleaning and visualizing NHANES health survey data.

## How to Run
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run each script individually in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.
